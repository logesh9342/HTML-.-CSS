# HTML & CSS Learning Repository

Welcome to my manual web development learning repository! This project is a hands-on journey through HTML and CSS—no frameworks, no libraries—just pure, foundational front-end development.

##  What's Inside

- **HTML & CSS folder**  
  Contains structured exercises, mini-projects, and learning examples organized by topic or feature (e.g., semantic layout, form styling, media embeds).
  
- **Deep dives**  
  You'll find files dedicated to specific concepts—like flexbox demos, responsive patterns, text styling exercises, and more.
