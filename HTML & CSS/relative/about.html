<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Welcome to our sample website!
This project was created to demonstrate the power and flexibility of **relative units in CSS**, such as `em`, `rem`, `%`, and `vh`. By using these units instead of fixed pixels, our layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and user preferences.
Our goal is to show how web design can be **responsive, accessible, and visually consistent** across devices — from large desktop screens to mobile phones. Every element on this site, including text, spacing, and layout, scales proportionally to ensure a smooth viewing experience.
This is more than just a demo; it’s a learning example for anyone who wants to explore modern, scalable, and user-friendly web design.
If you’d like, I can **shorten and make it more beginner-friendly** so it fits neatly on a small website section.
